Enhance my existing full-stack web app **EduConnect – Tutor-Student Platform**, built with **Node.js**, **React.js**, and **PostgreSQL**. The app already supports:

✅ Role-based login (Student & Tutor)  
✅ Course browsing with subject filtering  
✅ Students booking courses  
✅ Dashboards for Tutors and Students  
✅ Tutors confirming bookings  

Now, please implement the following **enhancements**:

🖌️ 1. **UI/UX Upgrade**:
- Use **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** for a modern, colorful, and responsive design  
- Improve overall navigation and accessibility  

👩‍💼 2. **Admin Role & Dashboard**:
- Introduce a third role: `Admin`  
- Add an **Admin Dashboard** with:
  - View all users (Students & Tutors)
  - Approve/Reject tutor applications (`isApproved` flag in DB)
  - Manage all courses (Add/Edit/Delete)
  - View platform statistics: total users, bookings, confirmed sessions

⭐ 3. **Ratings & Reviews**:
- Allow Students to rate and review a course *after it's confirmed by the Tutor*  
- Show average rating on course cards  
- Store in a new `reviews` table (PostgreSQL): `id`, `student_id`, `course_id`, `rating`, `review_text`, `created_at`

🔔 4. **Notification System**:
- Notify **Tutors** when a student books a course  
- Notify **Students** when a Tutor confirms a booking  
- Display notifications as badges or dropdowns (in-app), store in a `notifications` table:
  - `id`, `user_id`, `message`, `is_read`, `created_at`  
- Optional: Add email notifications

📚 5. **“My Courses” Section** on Student Dashboard:
- List all enrolled and confirmed courses  
- Display: course name, tutor name, status (pending/confirmed), session date, and a “Review” link (if confirmed)

🏠 6. **Homepage Revamp**:
- Use a banner with **TCE Campus Image** (from Google)  
- Add a short platform intro + buttons: [Register], [Browse Courses]

🎯 7. **Booking Workflow Enhancement**:
- When a Student **books** a course:
  - A **pending** request is sent to the Tutor  
  - The course status shows as **Pending** in the Student Dashboard  
- Once the Tutor **confirms**, the status updates to **Confirmed**  
- Notification should trigger both ways

🛠️ 8. **Preserve & Extend CRUD Operations**:
- Admin: manage all users and courses  
- Tutors: Add/Edit/Delete own courses  
- Students: View & review booked courses  

🔐 Continue using:
- **JWT** for secure Authentication  
- **REST API** for backend communication  
- **PostgreSQL** for the database

📦 Database Update Checklist:
- `users`: add `isApproved` (boolean) for Tutor approval  
- `notifications`: `id`, `user_id`, `message`, `is_read`, `created_at`  
- `reviews`: `id`, `student_id`, `course_id`, `rating`, `review_text`, `created_at`

📎 Note:
Ensure **backward compatibility** with existing working features and do not break the core flow.
